//IMonitorModule, which describes the behavior of one or your monitorâ€™s "modules"

/*
 *	Modules are awesome you know..
 *	They simply works independly, each one doesn't need any help from outside.
 *	This is true.
 *
 *	Cats & ponys are the master minds in this overall complex system.
 *  Ask the current day to a cat, he won't answer, that's the purpose of our very
 *	smart "Day&Time" module.
 *
 *	This is all, you see, very simple.
